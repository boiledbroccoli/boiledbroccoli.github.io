# Personal info
name: "Rankie Jiang"
bio: |
I am a PhD student in Psychology at Zhejiang University with a bachelor's degree in Applied Psychology from East China Normal University (ECNU). Currently, I am a visiting researcher at the [Language, Cognition and Learning (LCL) Lab](https://langcomplab.github.io/) under [Dr. Cynthia Siew](https://x.com/csqsiew)'s supervision at the National University of Singapore. 
My research focuses on language processing mechanisms, particularly Chinese character and word recognitionâ€”the core of my doctoral thesis. Beyond my thesis work, I am also interested in the broader sociolinguistic dimensions of language use, examining how language shapes and is shaped by cultural practices and social perceptions. Recently, I have been expanding into computational approaches, exploring Large Language Model (LLM) agents for social simulation, which bridges my traditional psycholinguistic research with cutting-edge AI methodologies to model linguistic behavior in social contexts.
